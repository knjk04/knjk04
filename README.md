### Hello!

I'm the original author and current maintainer of the [Book Project](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project) and the [Books API](https://github.com/Project-Books/books-api)

- Interests: machine learning (ML) & deep learning (as well as AI more broadly), science & maths

If you have a Book Project-related question, please create a new [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project/discussions) or ask on our Slack workspace.

### Sponsoring the Books API

I hate to ask for money, but the costs of running Azure Blob Storage for our Books API is prohibitive for me at $65 a month. If you're willing and are able to donate towards our development costs, it would greatly appreciated and beneficial to supporting our development. See the [sponsorship page](https://github.com/sponsors/knjk04/dashboard).
